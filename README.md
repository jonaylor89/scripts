# System Scripts

Updating all git repositories:
`update_git_repos.py` and `update_git_repos`

- Both scripts do the same things.
The latter is in bash because it was my first implementation of it and the former is the port I did of the script in python.

Updating pip packages:
`update_pip_packages.py`
 
 - Pretty self-explanatory

 Installation/Deployment:
 `install` 

 - Scripts gets executed by JARBS for deployment
